Improvements according to Claude Sonnet

```
Performance:

The relationship graph building function processes emails in batches, which is good, but consider implementing more efficient algorithms for large-scale data.
Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data or computationally expensive operations.


Scalability:

Consider implementing a worker queue system (e.g., Celery) for long-running tasks to improve responsiveness.
Implement pagination for large result sets in functions like get_emails_by_topic and semantic_search.


Testing:

Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability and ease future development.


Documentation:

Include more inline comments explaining complex algorithms or business logic.
Create API documentation for the main functions.


Error Handling:

Implement more specific exception handling instead of catching generic Exceptions in many places.
Consider creating custom exception classes for application-specific errors.


Feature Enhancements:

Implement email threading functionality to group related emails.
Add support for handling attachments in emails.
Implement more advanced NLP techniques like named entity recognition for better relationship mapping.


User Interface:

Consider creating a more robust web interface using a framework like Flask or FastAPI instead of relying solely on Gradio.


Data Import:

The current code doesn't seem to include functionality for importing emails. Implement methods to import emails from various sources (e.g., IMAP, EML files, PST files).


Compliance and Ethics:

Ensure the application complies with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) when handling personal data in emails.
Implement features for data anonymization or pseudonymization.


Monitoring and Maintenance:

Enhance the ApplicationMonitor class to include more detailed metrics and possibly integrate with a monitoring service.


Dependency Management:

Use a requirements.txt file or Poetry for better dependency management.


Configuration:

Implement a more robust configuration system, possibly using a library like python-decouple for managing environment variables and configuration files.
