### 101/What is this?<a name="what"></a>
- This is a simple application that is capable of performing the following:
  * Import a collection of emails as (X FIXME),
	* Perform analysis of said emails,
	* Identify topics of discussion,
	* Identify 'red flag' items, 
	* Perform topic identification,
	* Perform sentiment analysis,
	* Perform X
- The goal is to allow any individual interested to 'quickly' perform analysis and research into a collection of emails(documents eventually) so that they can identify interesting leads/pieces of information that may be relevant to their goals.
- This project is non-partisan. Equal opportunities and all that.

### Why? <a name="why"></a>
- I had a conversation with Jack Poulson(https://techinquiry.org/), and decided a project like this could be helpful to people.
- I believe that giving people tools to help them solve their goals that scale is one of the biggest helps one can do.
